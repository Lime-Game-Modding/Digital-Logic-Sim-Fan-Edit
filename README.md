# Digital-Logic-Sim : Fan Edit
A branch of the minimalistic digital logic simulator, which Sebastian Lague created as part of my video series: [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq).

You can find the original branche's latest builds over [here](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim).<br>

# The Fan Edit

The Fan Edit, also know as Fan Edition, or DLS 2 2, or DLS Too, adds as of today 2 new functionnalities.

First of all, it brings a new horizontal alignment customization option in the customization menu, when saving your chips.
Save files using the alignment customization options are 100% compatible with the Vanilla game (the text simply will always be center aligned in vanilla).
Vanilla text files are also fully compatible with DLS Fan Edit, simply they will not have text alignment.
These compatibilities are thanks to Sebastian Lague's good decisions when making the base branch.

In addition to this, it also adds the Diode, a chip that has a 1-pixel display that can either be on or off, depending on its single input. Although not very useful by itself, added to a chip in the customization screen, it can provide useful and simple information to help you debug your circuits while they are running.
